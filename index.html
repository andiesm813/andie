                    </figure>
                    <p>The phrase is a reflection of the theory of Minimalism and it’s becoming the new method of making simple, elegant and functional designs. The main principle is to provide only the essential part of the feature to the user.

                    <p>The false-consensus effect refers to people’s tendency to assume that others share their beliefs and will behave similarly in a given context. Only people who are very different from them would make different choices.

                    <p>KISS (Keep it simple, stupid!) is a design principle that favours simplicity. In UX and product design, this means focusing on just one user problem at a time and designing solutions that are easy to understand, use, and navigate.
